# Guard Resource Distribution Protocol

## Overview
The **Guard Resource Distribution Protocol** enables secure, controlled, and conditional distribution of digital resources between entities. The protocol ensures that digital resource containers can only be accessed, distributed, or altered under specific conditions, with multiple layers of validation and control to prevent unauthorized operations.

The protocol includes several key features:
- **Emergency Lockdown Release**: Allows authorized entities to release locked containers under secure conditions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid operations by a single entity.
- **Authority Delegation**: Allows delegation of container management to secondary authorities.
- **Multi-signature Approvals**: Adds an extra layer of security for high-value container operations.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Provides a framework for managing disputes between resource originators and beneficiaries.
- **Fallback Entity Registration**: Ensures that a fallback entity is available in case of an emergency.

## Features
- **Resource Containers**: Define containers for digital resources with specific conditions for initiation, status tracking, and termination.
- **Rate Limits**: Control the frequency of container operations for better security and integrity.
- **Delegation and Revocation**: Delegate authority to other entities with specific timeframes and conditions.
- **Lockdown & Emergency Operations**: Containers can be locked down for emergency conditions and restored upon verification.
- **Dispute Handling**: Initiate, resolve, or adjudicate disputes over resource distribution.

## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- [Clarity Language](https://claritylang.org/) environment for smart contract deployment
- Blockstack or similar blockchain environment for contract execution

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Guard-Resource-Distribution-Protocol.git
   cd Guard-Resource-Distribution-Protocol
   ```

2. Deploy the smart contract to the blockchain:
   - Set up the necessary environment for deploying Clarity contracts.
   - Deploy the contract to the desired network (e.g., Stacks).

### Usage:
- Use the provided functions to interact with the protocol:
  - `release-container-lockdown`: Release a locked resource container.
  - `reset-operation-rate-limit`: Reset rate limits for an entity.
  - `delegate-container-authority`: Delegate management authority for a container.
  - `execute-resource-distribution`: Finalize resource distribution to the beneficiary.
  - `initiate-dispute`: Start a dispute process for a resource container.

### Example Usage:
```clarity
// Release a container from lockdown
(define-public (release-container-lockdown 12345 "verification-code-hash" tx-sender))
```
